# Note
The principal analysis is present in the `notebooks` folder. The various "training" files outside the notebooks folder, are just for using my local computational power without accessing Jupyter/Colab.

The notebook that best describes the working process is the one named "Training". The other notebooks deal with different approach, that usually use code from "Training".

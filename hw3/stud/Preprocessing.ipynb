       "text          Upon her arrival, she was granted Drottningholm Palace as her summer residence, where the ''Young Court'', as it was called, amused themselves with picnics, masquerades and French language amateur theater. The crown prince's court was dominated by Carl Gustaf Tessin, who escorted Louisa Ulrika to Sweden and remained an influential favorite during her years as crown princess. Adolf Frederick never cared much for Tessin, but Louisa Ulrika had him appointed marshal at court and eventually royal governor of her son prince Gustav. Tessin was behind many amusements in the circle of the crown princess, and it was said that he was only too eager to please Louisa Ulrika in any way possible. There were unconfirmed rumors that Tessin was the lover of Louisa Ulrika during her tenure as crown princess. Her son Gustav III later addressed these rumors, that although Count Tessin had been in love with her, his feelings were one-sided and not answered by his mother, as a love affair with a noble contradicted the ''natural contempt'' which Louisa Ulrika herself as a royal felt for every subject, noble or not. Her circle at court included Henrika Juliana von Liewen, who immediately became her favorite among her ladies-in-waiting; the intellectual Cath*rine Charlotte De la Gardie, the scientist Eva Ekeblad, and the witty Anders Johan von H*pken.\n",

Initially hired for only one year, he remained on contract through 2009. For much of his first decade on the show, Palmer was a ruthless villain, totally possessive of his daughter, Nina and violently threatening his ex-wife Daisy with being attacked by dobermans when she came back from the dead.   \n",

He published at London ''Letteratura Dantesca: Remarks on the Reading of the 114th Verse of the 7th Canto of the Paradise of the ''Divina Commedia'''' (1857), and two years afterwards ''Francesca da Rimini, her Lament and Vindication; with a brief Notice of the Malatesti'' (1859, 2nd edition, 1875). An Italian translation, ''Francesca da Rimini, suo Lamento e Difesa,'' &c., in Filippo Scolari's ''Esercitazioni Dantesche,'' appeared at Venice in 1865. Barlow published in 1862 ''Il Gran Rifiuto, what it was, who made it, and how fatal to Dante Allighieri,'' on verses 58 to 63 of the 3rd canto of the Inferno; an Italian translation by G. G(uiscardi) appeared at Naples in 1864. Barlow also issued in 1862 ''Il Conte Ugolino e l'Arcivescovo Ruggieri: a Sketch from the Pisan Chronicles,'' and a fragment of English history, entitled ''The Young King and Bertrand de Born,'' from which the author deduced an amended reading in line 135 of the 28th canto of the ''Inferno.'' In 1864 Barlow published the final result of his work on the ''Divina Commedia,'' ''Critical, Historical, and Philosophical Contributions to the Study of the ''Divina Commedia.''''   \n",

During a windy break, Lisa can't inhale any smoke. She realizes her only alternative is to actually smoke a cigarette, and picks one up. Right as she is about to smoke it, her father arrives and takes it away, by throwing it on the ground, squishing it with his foot, and then shooting it with a gun several times, and he is shown to be putting the gun away into his jacket. (which is also filled with other guns and weapons) Appalled, he goes to tell Marge that Lisa needs to be taken out of the ballet academy, but discovers how proud she is of Lisa; Homer is unable bear to destroy Marge's happiness.   \n",

Llewellyn impressed by taking five wickets but was surprisingly left out of the second Test. At the end of the 1898--99 series Llewellyn, perturbed by the actions of the selectors and seeking financial security, left South Africa to play for English county side Hampshire County Cricket Club as a professional, on the recommendation of South African team-mate Major Robert Poore, an ex-Hampshire cricketer on military assignment. He would star for Hampshire for over a decade, scoring 8772 runs at 27.58 and snaring 711 wickets at 24.66.   \n",

Conversations with locals led Service to write about things he had not seen (some of which had not actually happened) as well. He did not set foot in Dawson City until 1908, arriving in the Klondike ten years after the Gold Rush when his renown as a writer was already established. After having collected enough poems for a book, Service ''sent the poems to his father, who had emigrated to Toronto, and asked him to find a printing house so they could make it into a booklet. He enclosed a cheque to cover the costs and intended to give these booklets away to his friends in Whitehorse'' for Christmas. His father took the manuscript to William Briggs in Toronto, whose employees loved the book. ''The foreman and printers recited the ballads while they worked. A salesman read the proofs out loud as they came off the typesetting machines.'' An ''enterprising salesman sold 1700 copies in advance orders from galley proofs.'' The publisher ''sent Robert's cheque back to him and offered a ten percent royalty contract for the book.'   \n",

She then returned to the show as a series regular again in April 1999, signing a two-year contract.

Last episode that feature Smriti was telecasted on 6 June 2007, where she dies in a truck accident. After a long hiatus of 11 months, amidst the decline of Kyunki's viewership, Ekta Kapoor got back Smriti into her role in a highly publicized affair, where they both buried their hatchet with each other in a public appearance.\n",

       "text          This claim was contested by Richard Worsley, half-brother of James, in the Court of Wards and Liveries in 1563, when it was awarded that Sir Robert was to take a third, afterwards known as the manor of Ryde, while Richard was to have the part which had been bequeathed by Giles to his widow Margaret, comprising the site of the manor. Richard Worsley died at Ashey 31 August 1599, when the manor came to his son Bowyer, afterwards knighted by James I. According to his contemporary, Sir John Oglander, Sir Bowyer Worsley was a reckless, improvident man. His son John having predeceased him, he sold Ashey in 1624 to Thomas Cotele.\n",
